# Challenge: Odd Divisor

Goal:
Define function f as the solution to get the largest odd divisor of x, x is a positive integer, e.g. f(44)=11,
now given n, calculate the value of f(1) +  f(2)  + f(3) + ... + f(n).
For example:
n=7
f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) + f(5) + f(6) + f(7) = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 7 = 21
input: 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000000, or even larger    

The fastest function wins. Good luck!

## Requirements

- Fastest performing solution wins
- Must work in browser and node.js if written in javascript. Any other language is allowed.
